# Playground for Efficient Algorithms

This repository will hopefully contain some hacky implementations of
algorithms from the *Efficient Algorithms* lecture.

## Structure

- 0. Introduction
    - `fib.py`: Two implementations for the Fibonacci numbers
- 1. Basics
    - `stable-matching.py`: Stable Matching (Gale, Shapley)
    - `graphs.py`: Simple graph representation, DFS
- 2. Greedy algorithm
    - `interval-scheduling.py`: Greates subset of overlapping intervals
